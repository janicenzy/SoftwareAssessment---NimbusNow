            <h3>Gathering Lightning Thoughts...</h3>
            <p class="beginning">For the front page, I took inspiration and asked a peer (Anastasia) for assistance<br> with the clickable logo that transitions into the weather webpage. I learnt about timing the animation transition <br> from one webpage to another through css @keyframes. 
               Additionally, I set the background to a <br> timelapse of evolving weather I got off youtube: credits to <a id='canva' href='https://www.youtube.com/@TimestormFilms'>Martin (Timestorm Film)</a>.
               <br>
               <br>
               <iframe id='ya' width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NW4AP3gIu-0?si=1bVbQ7O_zoNiivTj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
               <br>
               <br>

               As for the sign-up page, I created a secondary page that checks the form validation; takes in input from <br> the user and verifys if the boxes have been filled or not, returning either a completion or 'Please fill out the boxes'.<br>
               In an attempt to advance even further, I tried connecting an online SMTP server (as seen below in my javascript code). <br> <br>

        <section>
            <h3>The Storm</h3>
            <p class="beginning">Making the weather page, at first I created a couple of storyboards to make a <br> rough draft/layout of how I want the website to appear to its users.<br></p>
            <br>

            <div class="image-container">
            <img class='storyboard' src="frontpage.png" alt="Website storyboard drafts">  <img class='storyboard' src="scrollpage.png" alt="Website storyboard drafts"> 
            </div> <br>

            <p class="beginning">Starting out, I created the navigation bar at the top to which I struggled with making the navigation bar a block. <br> I tried utilising artifical intelligence to spot the error in my code and found that I hadn't set the colour and opacity of the bar, <br> creating an illusion of a navigation bar instead of a still block regardless of whether or not the user scrolls down or not; <br> so I set the position to fixed.
            Next over, I went on a research spree on learning about weather API's, how to fetch data and import the files. <br> The learning process was fairly easy compared to the steep hill of hardship when it came to the practical. <br>
            I started out my typing out the default screen of the weather site, however, with the particular API I'm using it would <br> only allow cities and not specific places/suburbs such as Cabramatta. I also used the weatherapi icons <br> and aligned it with the changing weather.
            The CSS component was fairly easy: I set the background, set the side panel with <br> the search button in addition to other weather-related information and nearby cities <br> (respective to our area - doesn't change depending on the user's location so that could be an extension task to complete).</p>

            <h3>Clearing Skies</h3>
            <p class="beginning"> Although the javascript component was challenging at first, I researched more to refine my scripting skills and broke it up into parts: </p>
            <div class="middle1">
                <ol>
                    <li>Adding a click event that changes the cities info using fetchWeatherData();</li>
                    <li>Search validation if the user clicks on the search button, an alert will <br> show, if not then screen will reload to entered city and display its data</li>
                    <li>Created a function that gets and returns the day, date and time</li>
                    <li>Lastly, putting everything together under the fetchWeatherData(); function <br> and called it at the end</li>
                </ol>  

            <iframe id="ya" width="560" height="315" src="weather1.js"></iframe>

        </div>

        <section>
            <h3>Smooth Sailing!</h3>
            <p class="beginning">After the javascript, I found a few errors with the overall appearance of the website so I changed the background images to <br> higher-quality captures and fixed the yellow overlay on my glassmorphism panel that holds the extra information + nearby cities. <br>
                Moreover, I opened attempted learning additional CSS page transitions - adding a better transntion for when the user clicks the logo <br> on the front page. 
                Creating this website has not only allowed me ot refresh my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript but also has helped me <br> gain confidence in my js coding,
                through all the tutorials I've read and watched online to the Grok Leanring and Code Combat tasks. <br> Although I found myself struggling more than enjoying myself, as I allowed myself to fail (mainly in linking the weatherapi) this task has <br>
                allowed me to enjoy the process of trial and error rather than staying behind the comfortable threshold of 'passable' and 'overachieving'. <br>
                Nontheless, NimbusNow grants you weather all day, everyday<br>
                <br>
                Whether the weather is good or bad.
